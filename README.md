Welcome to the Jokester App!

We at Jokester believe there's nothing better than a good joke to brighten up your day. 

While we realize that certain jokes aren't for everyone, this app does contain jokes that may contain NSFW (Not Safe For Work), religious, political, racist, sexist, and/or explicit material. 

Fortunately for our users, we've provided a 'WARNING' that blocks out potentially sensitive, 'flagged' content before the user can access it. 


# To read our jokes

- All of our jokes load for users in its own card
- The 'Setup' for each joke is in the grey box
- Below the grey box is our Warning disclaimer
- To read the 'punchline' (or delivery) for each joke, simply hover over the warning
- To re-hide the punchline, hover over it and the Warning will come back to hide the punchline

## To 'Like' our jokes

- Click on the 'Like' button to LIKE the joke
- Everytime a user likes a joke, the like counter increases
- These likes never go away. Users can come back and like a joke again at any time.
